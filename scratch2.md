- CLI flag casing standard in help/flags: adopt consistent style? (Docs mention casing for keys but
  not flags; likely keep kebab-case flags.)

yeah we can formalize kebab casing and note it in the docs. 

- Do we also allow kanbanStatusLine on ai_get root note frontmatter echo? Probably not necessary
  now; neighbors is sufficient.

i think it should be included as context ideally it's a very highlevel descriptor which is useful.
