# cli-rag

A CLI based system for creating and managing Obsidian compliant YAML front matter. This creates a simplifed DAG that allows a local "region" to be called by an LLM.

You've found this way too early! Nothing here is ready for production. :) This will all be cleaned up over the next few days. But i would not use this right now.
