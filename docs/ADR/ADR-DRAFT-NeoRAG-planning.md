# NeoRAG-planning

## Objective
<!-- A concise statement explaining the goal of this decision. -->

Until this point CLI-RAG has grown adhoc out of a a dog-fooded .js script. As the workflow is becoming more clear the existing commands should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure everything is coherent. 

## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->

## Decision
<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->

## Consequences
<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->
