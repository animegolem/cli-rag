# Org Agenda 

## Objective
<!-- A concise statement explaining the goal of this decision. -->

Goal: The main TUI screen shows a agenda somehow created across notes in front matter maybe even a simple "due now" or a data entry flag 

This could be structured as a `validated_frontmatter` with a check against a due date field. It's logical but I don't honestly work that way. I more would want to be able to flag things in notes and somehow have that create a todolist with priority buckets. 

## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->

## Decision
<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->

## Consequences
<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->

## Updates
<!-- Changes that happened when the rubber met the road -->
