## Worthy 

```
  Complexity Creep: The config is getting
  sophisticated. Consider:
  - Ship with 2-3 battle-tested preset configs users
  can extend
  - cli-rag init --preset=adr-simple vs
  --preset=full-featured
```

This is just a good idea yeah. create a preset folder of example use cases. 

## Who Knows

  What's Missing

  Given "teams who think in git":
  - Merge conflict resolution for IDs (when two
  branches create same ID)
  - Pre-commit hooks (validate before commit)
  - Diff-friendly output (sorted JSON, stable ordering)
  - Team migration tools (import from
  Confluence/Notion/Google Docs?)
 ```

```
  The system is positioning itself as a
  "programmer-friendly Obsidian that lives in a repo" -
   this is actually a strong identity! Lean into it:
   
  - Git-native knowledge management
  - CI/CD friendly validation
  - Team-shared architectural decisions
  - No proprietary formats or lock-in
```

```
  This Tera-based approach could expand to:
  - Template inheritance (extends = "base-adr")
  - Conditional sections based on frontmatter
  - Auto-generated sections from git history or code
  analysis
```




# Unprocessed GPT-5 

This is already a solid shape for a portable “ADR/IMP RAG + validator” config. With just this context, here’s where it really works—and the edges I’d sand down so it stays ergonomic across repos.

# Where it makes strong sense

- **Separation of concerns:** global scan/setup (`[file.paths]`, `[defaults]`) + per-type behavior (`[[schema]]`). That maps cleanly to multi-repo reuse.
    
- **Schema-driven validation:** `required_frontmatter`, `validated_frontmatter`, and `schema.rules.*` give you a crisp contract and let CI fail fast. Great for taming LLM drift.
    
- **LLM-aware authoring:** a full `template` with placeholders + title casing rules is perfect for “scaffold → edit → validate.”
    
- **Strictness knobs:** `unknown_frontmatter_policy` + `heading_policy` let you dial rigor per schema, which is crucial as projects mature.
    
- **Future escape hatch:** `validator_wasm` is a good extension seam for project-specific rules without bloating the core.
    

# Watch-outs & tweaks I’d recommend

**1) Scanning & indexing**

- `ignore_globs` currently excludes `**/lib/**` and `**/src/**`. If any ADRs (or referenced files) live under those, you’ll confuse `related_files` checks and backlinks. Consider moving ADRs under a docs/ subtree and **only** ignore heavy build artifacts (`node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, target/).
    
- `include_content = true` as a default can make indexes huge and slow. Suggest:
    
    - default `include_content = false`
        
    - add a per-command flag (e.g., `bundle --with-content`) or a per-schema override for content-bearing types.
        

**2) Front-matter policy**

- `unknown_frontmatter_policy = "strict"` is excellent for LLM containment, but it’s brittle for humans over time. Two options:
    
    - Allow **vendor keys**: anything starting with `x_` or `x-` is ignored by strict mode.
        
    - Add `allowed_frontmatter = ["id","tags","status","related_files","depends_on","created_date","last_modified","x_*"]`
        
- `validated_frontmatter = ["created_date","last_modified"]` updates can cause noisy diffs and merge pain if you auto-write on every keystroke. Prefer:
    
    - Only set `created_date` in the `new` command.
        
    - Compute `last_modified` at index time (store in the index, **not** in the file), or update on commit via a hook, not during edit.
        

**3) Identity & cross-refs**

- `identity_source = "frontmatter"` works; still define a **canonical ID regex** per schema (e.g., `ADR-\d{3}(-[A-Z]+-\d{3})?`) so `depends_on` validation can give precise errors and suggest closest matches.
    
- Decide whether `depends_on` may **cross schemas** (ADR ↔ IMP). If yes, encode the keyspace: `depends_on = ["ADR:024","IMP:006"]` or infer by regex per target.
    

**4) Rules model**

- `schema.rules.status.allowed_plain` is good; consider **transitions** too (e.g., `draft → proposed → accepted | cancelled`, `accepted → superseded`). This enables a friendly “cannot go from draft → superseded” error.
    
- `schema.rules.related_files.allowed_regex = ["*.ex*", "*.py", ...]` — globs like `*.ex*` are loose. Prefer anchored regex or explicit extensions: `\.exs?$`, `\.md$`, `\.toml$`. Also choose whether paths are relative to repo root or note dir and enforce normalization.
    

**5) Template ergonomics**

- You used `((required_frontmatter))` in the template, but the comment mentions `((frontmatter))`. Pick one convention and support:
    
    - `((frontmatter required))`, `((frontmatter validated))`, `((frontmatter all))`
        
- Title casing: global `title.format` is great—also allow **per-schema override** so ADRs can be `kebab-case` but “Lore” stays freeform.
    

**6) CI and editor flow**

- Make strictness **profiled**:
    
    - `profile = "dev" | "ci"` under `[defaults]`, and optional per-schema `profile_overrides`. In `dev`, unknown fields = warning; in `ci`, error.
        
- Offer `--fix` and `--dry-run` on all validators. Many issues (case, missing headings) can be autofixed safely; let CI print a patch.
    

**7) Migrations & aging docs**

- Add `schema.version = 1` and a `migrations = ["migrate/adr_v1_to_v2.toml"]`. Then a `migrate` command can rewrite front-matter/headers when you evolve the schema without manual churn.
    

**8) Performance & determinism**

- Consider an `index.strategy = "metadata|content|hybrid"` and `hash_mode = "mtime|content"` so large repos don’t thrash re-indexing on non-content changes.
    
- For reproducibility, pin time formatting (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and timezone (`UTC`) in date validators.
    

**9) Security & WASM**

- If you expose `validator_wasm`, sandbox it: deny network, restrict FS to the note path, set CPU/mem limits; pass inputs by value, outputs via a JSON report. A misbehaving validator shouldn’t brick the repo.
    

**10) Minor polish / typos**

- Comments: `asvalidated` → “as validated”; “Alterantively” → “Alternatively”; “retrevial” → “retrieval”.
    
- `[file.paths]` might read clearer as `[scan]` or `[index]`, but that’s bikeshedding.
    

# Small, concrete changes I’d make now

- Flip `include_content` default to `false`; add a `bundle` command that hydrates content on demand.
    
- Add vendor key escape: `allowed_frontmatter` + `x_*` pattern.
    
- Tighten file rules to proper regexes; document path base.
    
- Add `id_pattern` and `ref_targets = ["ADR","IMP"]` to the ADR schema.
    
- Introduce `profiles` (`dev` vs `ci`) so strictness doesn’t fight writing.
    
- Move `last_modified` out of the file and into the index by default.
    

# A tightened ADR schema (drop-in example)

```toml
[[schema]]
name = "ADR"
file_patterns = ["docs/**/ADR-*.md", "docs/**/ADR-DB-*.md"]
identity_source = "frontmatter"

id_pattern = "^ADR-(DB-)?\\d{3}$"
ref_targets = ["ADR","IMP"]

required_frontmatter = ["id","tags","status","related_files"]
allowed_frontmatter  = ["id","tags","status","related_files","depends_on","created_date","x_*"]
unknown_frontmatter_policy = "strict"

validated_frontmatter = ["depends_on","created_date"]

heading_policy = "loose"

[schema.rules.status]
allowed_plain = ["draft","proposed","accepted","superseded","cancelled"]
# optional: define legal transitions for friendlier errors
# transitions = { draft = ["proposed"], proposed = ["accepted","cancelled"], accepted = ["superseded"] }
severity = "error"

[schema.rules.related_files]
allowed_regex = ["\\.exs?$","\\.py$","\\.js$","\\.md$","\\.toml$"]
base = "repo" # or "note"
severity = "warning"

template = """
((frontmatter required))

# {{id}}-{{title}}

## Objective
## Context
## Decision
## Consequences
## Updates
"""
```

If you want, I can turn this into a minimal Rust `clap` skeleton for `validate`, `new`, `bundle`, and `migrate`, plus a tiny test harness so you can drop it into your repo and get the dev/ci profiles on day one.
