# 2025-09-18-LOG-AI-ai-index-alignment

## Work Completed
- Finalized dogfooding migration commits (planning docs + config) and captured ADR contract alignment epic/IMPs.
- Implemented **AI-IMP-022**: exposed `cli-rag ai index plan|apply`, deprecated the legacy aliases with warnings, and refreshed docs/CI/changelog accordingly.
- Authored planning docs for **AI-IMP-023/024/025/026** to cover template parity, output destinations, legacy `new` deprecation, and help/completions refresh.

## Session Commits
- 402ac81 `AI-IMP-022: unify ai index subcommands and deprecate aliases` – code + docs changes.
- f7db077 `imp: AI-IMP-025 deprecate legacy new; AI-IMP-026 help/README/completions refresh (planning only)`.
- 598f78d `imp: AI-IMP-023 template parity …; AI-IMP-024 output destination keys (planning only)`.
- 2b905ea `imp: AI-IMP-022 ai subcommand alignment — planning only (no code)`.
- 82f37ee `epic: ADR contract alignment (AI-EPIC-003) — planning only (no code)`.
- 5268b55 `dogfooding: adopt nested .cli-rag.toml …` (config + schema docs).

## Issues Encountered
- Needed to maintain compatibility with the alias commands while emitting warnings; ensured warnings stay single-line and suppressible for CI by future env plumbing.
- Adjusted integration tests to verify deprecation messaging without making assertions overly brittle.

## Tests Added
- `tests/integration_ai_index_plan.rs`: new alias-warning coverage and updated `ai index plan` invocation.
- `tests/integration_ai_index_apply.rs`: new alias-warning coverage plus validation of `ai index apply` behavior in dry-run/full modes.

## Next Steps
- Implement **AI-IMP-023** (template parity) and **AI-IMP-024** (output destinations) now that planning docs are in place.
- Follow with **AI-IMP-025/026** to deprecate `new` and refresh help/README/completions.
- After implementation, consider documenting env flag to suppress deprecation warnings in CI if required.
