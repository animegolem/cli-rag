## Questionable Questions

- How do I mark a due date as complete if kanban is free entry? 
- I need a universal note with little formatting like a "scratch pad" maybe even add a concept like the emacs quick scratch pad. 
- develop a second preset for my personal notes and start slowly stretching this out like org mode is the long term end game if stuck with. but a basic second preset makes sense for launch.
