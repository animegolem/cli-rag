# 2025-10-09-LOG-AI-cli-edges-policy-uplift

## Work Completed
- Drafted AI-IMP-034 implementation: config schema now models `validate.edges` policies (per edge requirements, cross-schema whitelist, wikilinks placeholder).
- Updated validation pipeline to enforce required edge presence, unknown ID detection for user-defined edge fields, and cross-schema target checks; per-edge cycle severity now overrides schema defaults.
- Extended validator diagnostics (`EDGE_REQUIRED_MISSING`, `EDGE_ID_NOT_FOUND`, `EDGE_CROSS_SCHEMA_DISALLOWED`) and ensured JSON output remains contract compliant.
- Added focused unit tests covering required edge enforcement, cross-schema rejection, and cycle severity override to lock behaviour before tackling FR-9.

## Session Commits
- No commits pushed yet; changes remain in the working tree while we refine the broader AI-IMP-034/033 plan.

## Issues Encountered
- Validation helper assumed frontmatter-only docs; tests needed minimal frontmatter (`id`) to match production parsing. Adjusted fixtures accordingly.
- Cycle severity required harmonising schema-level defaults with per-edge overrides; introduced shared severity ranking to avoid conflicting policies.

## Tests Added
- New unit cases in `src/validate/tests.rs` covering: missing required edge diagnostics, cross-schema disallowance, and cycle detection severity override. Verified full suite with `cargo test`.

## Next Steps
- Spin up AI-IMP-033 to implement unique-target wikilink thresholds using the newly parsed config surface.
- Document precedence and policy defaults (AI-IMP-036) once FR-9/10 behaviour is finalised.
- Plan to revisit diagnostic wording after wikilinks work to maintain consistency across new codes.
