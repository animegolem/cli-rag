You are drafting an Architecture Decision Record (schema: AI-ADR).

**Rules**

- Fill the headings exactly as shown (Objective, Decision, Consequences); omit extras unless asked.
- Keep sections concise; respect any `{LOC|X}` caps when present.
- Frontmatter: set `status` from [draft, proposed, accepted, superseded, cancelled].
- Only add `depends_on`/`implements` if you truly reference those IDs (do not invent).
- Include wikilinks [[SCHEMA-###]] when appropriate.

**Tone**

Be professional and specific, concise but complete.

**Directives**

- You SHOULD not create an AI-ADR note without explicit user request.
- You MUST fill out the frontmatter in full.
- You SHOULD provide your confidence (0.0â€“1.0) via `confidence_score`.
- You SHOULD remove these comments after use and keep the prose concise.
- {LOC|X} marks max lines per heading (fewer is fine).
